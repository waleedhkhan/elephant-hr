<p class="lead">You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.</p>

Yeah, gimme a Tab. He's a very strange young man. Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon.

Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Hello. I've gotta go. Actually, people call me Marty. So tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Yeah, well history is gonna change. Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall? Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

Uh, look me up when you get there. Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Yeah. I have a feeling too. Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on you're head. How's your head? Back to the future.

Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born. I'm gonna ram him. Leave her alone, you bastard. Wrecked? Mom, is that you?

I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. Yeah. Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car. Ronald Reagon. You'll find out.

> “Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Why am I always the last one to know about these things. Oh, oh Marty, here's you keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about? What happens to us in the future? What do we become assholes or something?”

I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Ah. Whoa. Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row. Listen, Doc.

Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo He's a very strange young man. Well, I figured, what the hell. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Uh, yeah.
