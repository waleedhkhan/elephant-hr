<p class="lead">Listen, Doc. Leave her alone, you bastard. Right, and where am I gonna be? Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.</p>

Thanks, thanks a lot. She's just trying to keep you respectable. What? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Hello, Jennifer. And where's my reports? Whoa, this is heavy. Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Maybe you were adopted.

Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? He's a peeping tom. Dad. No, Doc.

A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Where were we. God dammit, I'm late. Marty, are you alright?

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Calm down, Marty, I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact.

I hope so. Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive. No.

Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Now which one was it, Greg or Craig? Never mind that now, never mind that now. Hello. Where's Einstein, is he with you?

After I fell off my toilet, I drew this. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. Huh? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Are you okay? That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town. I'm gonna be at the dance. Flux capacitor.

Aw yeah, everything is great. Doc. Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doing all day? Whoa, whoa, okay. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.

Ahh. Ahh. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Ah well, sort of. Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh. It was meant to be. Anyway, if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

Did you hurt your head? Precisely. No. Its good. Why is she gonna get angry with you?

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. I'll get it back to you, alright? Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc? Um, well it's a delorean, right? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.
