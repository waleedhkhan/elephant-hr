<p class="lead">What? Doc, she didn't even look at him. He's alright. Right. Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-</p>

Are those my clocks I hear? I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Are you gonna order something, kid? Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Right. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

Oh, just a little weather experiment. Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Listen, Doc.

I haven't I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? You too. Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

Right check, Doc. Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Erased from existence. Right. Never?

Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me. C'mon. That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Oh, what I meant to day was-

McFly. What? What's with the life preserver? C'mon, more, dammit. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do ninety. Precisely.

Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Marty you gotta come back with me.

Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Yeah, it's 8:00. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two.

Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nuttcase. You hang around with him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Marty, that was very interesting music. Right. That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

Excuse me. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. I followed you. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- I have a feeling too. Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc. That's good advice, Marty.

How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Weight has nothing to do with it. It's my dad.

Alright, McFly, you're asking for it, and now you're gonna get it. Who, who? C'mon, c'mon let's go. Right, gimme a Pepsi free. Yeah.

Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? The storm. Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. I've gotta go.

I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Yeah. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. I over slept, look I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. I have to ask Lorraine out but I don't know how to do it. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

He's your brother, Mom. No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. Doc, she didn't even look at him. I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations. Flux capacitor.

I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. C'mon, c'mon. Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Shit.

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. I said the keys are in here. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head. No, not yet. Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Um, well it's a delorean, right? Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda I just wanna use the phone. No, why, what's a matter? Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum.

Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin. Marty, that was very interesting music. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. What's going on? Where have you been all week? You bet.

You got a permit for that? Marty, such a nice name. Yeah, sure, okay. Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. Woh, hey, listen, you gotta help me. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.

That's George McFly? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright? Well maybe you are and you just don't know it yet. I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it. I mean, what if they say I'm no good. What if they say, 'Get out of here, kid, you got no future.' I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. Keys? Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we got to show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Ah well, sort of. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Marty, why are you so nervous?

It's about the future, isn't it? No. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Scram, McFly.

Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. I have a feeling too. Are those my clocks I hear? Ahh. Yeah.

Unroll their fire. Where were we. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that it's 8:25? I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. No, I refuse to except the responsibility.
